# Facial-Expression-Detection-Model

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify facial expressions into different categories such as **angry, happy, sad, etc.**.  
The system processes grayscale facial images, applies preprocessing and augmentation techniques, and uses a deep learning model to achieve robust classification performance.

## üöÄ Features
- Facial expression classification into multiple categories.
- Data preprocessing including normalization and resizing.
- **Data Augmentation** to handle class imbalance and improve model generalization.
- **MTCNN** for accurate face detection and alignment from raw images.
- Training a CNN model with optimized hyperparameters.
